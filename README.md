tectonicdb is a fast, highly compressed standalone database and streaming protocol for order book ticks.

## Why

* Uses a simple and efficient binary file format: Dense Tick Format(DTF)

* Stores order book tick data tuple of shape: `(timestamp, seq, is_trade, is_bid, price, size)`.

* Sorted by timestamp + seq

* 12 bytes per orderbook event

* 600,000 inserts per thread second

## Installation

There are several ways to install tectonicdb.

1.  **Binaries**

Binaries are available for [download](https://github.com/0b01/tectonicdb/releases). Make sure to put the path to the binary into your PATH. Currently only build is for Linux x86_64.

2.  **Crates**

    cargo install tdb tdb-server

This command will download `tdb` and `tdb-server` from crates.io and build locally.

3.  **GitHub**

To contribute you will need the copy of the source code on your local machine.

    git clone https://github.com/0b01/tectonicdb
    cd tectonicdb
    cargo build --release
    cargo run --release tdb-server

The binaries can be found under `target/` folder.

## How to use

It's very easy to setup.

```
chmod +x tdb-server
./tdb-server --help
```

For example:

```bash
./tdb-server -vv -a -i 10000
# run the server on INFO verbosity
# turn on autoflush for every 10000 inserts per orderbook
```

### Data commands

```
USE [dbname]
ADD [ts], [seq], [is_trade], [is_bid], [price], [size];
INSERT 1505177459.685, 139010, t, f, 0.0703620, 7.65064240; INTO dbname
```

## Monitoring

There is a history granularity option that sets the interval (in second) to periodically record item count for each orderbook, which then can be retrieved by issuing a `PERF` command.

## Logging

Log file defaults to `tdb.log`.

## Testing

```bash
export RUST_TEST_THREADS=1
cargo test
```

Tests must be run sequentially because some tests depend on dtf files that other tests generate.

## Benchmark

tdb client comes with a benchmark mode. This command inserts 1M records into the tdb.

```bash
tdb -b 1000000
```

Should be around 400000 inserts per second.

## Using dtf files

Tectonic comes with a commandline tool `dtfcat` to inspect the file metadata and all the stored events into either JSON or CSV.

Options:

```
USAGE:
    dtfcat [FLAGS] --input <INPUT>

FLAGS:
    -c, --csv         output csv
    -h, --help        Prints help information
    -m, --metadata    read only the metadata
    -V, --version     Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -i, --input <INPUT>    file to read
```

## As a library

It is possible to use the Dense Tick Format streaming protocol / file format in a different application. Works nicely with any buffer implementing the `Write` trait.

TectonicDB is a standalone service.
